Best order to create them (so nothing blocks you)

src/data/load.py
You can’t do anything until data loads reliably.

src/features/build.py
Get to X, y quickly and prove a baseline works.

src/models/train.py
Train a baseline model (Linear/Ridge) and save it.

src/models/evaluate.py
Add metrics + one plot; now you can report results.

src/pipelines/main.py
Glue it together into a one-command run.

src/data/validate.py
Add guardrails once the pipeline runs end-to-end.

src/data/split.py
Improve evaluation realism (split by year, etc.).

src/models/predict.py
Inference for “new wrestler rows” and demo usage.

src/utils/seed.py and src/utils/logging.py (optional)
Polish and reproducibility.

What you can run at each milestone

After #3: you can train something

After #4: you can measure it

After #5: you can run everything end-to-end with one command
